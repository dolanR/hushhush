Hush Hush are a 4-piece American Post hardcore band from Buffalo, NY, USA. The band formed in 2022 from a collection of energetic, 
fun-loving dudes who met under the careful selection of frontman, Dominic Villa. Taking influences from bands such as Pierce the Veil, 
Escape the Fate, and old school pop punk bands, their unique brand of entertainment fuses catchy guitar rhythms and melodies with driving 
bass lines to create a post hardcore/pop punk fusion. The band strives to bring a high energy show that will make you want to bop around 
whilst singing along with every word.
